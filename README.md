## How It Works

RustChat is designed as three focused services working together:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│   Web Client    │────▶│  RustChat API    │◀────│  Push Proxy     │
│  (Vue.js SPA)   │     │  (Rust/Axum)     │     │ (Mobile Push)   │
└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                               │
           ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
           ▼                   ▼                   ▼
      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────────┐
      │PostgreSQL│      │  Redis   │      │S3-compatible │
      │(Primary) │      │(Pub/Sub) │      │(File Store)  │
      └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────────────┘
```

**The Backend** — A Rust service handling REST APIs, WebSocket connections, and business logic. It speaks two protocols:
- `/api/v1/*` — Native API for the web client
- `/api/v4/*` — Mattermost-compatible API for mobile and desktop clients

**The Frontend** — A Vue.js single-page application that works in any modern browser. No Electron, no desktop installers.

**The Push Proxy** — A dedicated service for mobile push notifications (FCM for Android, APNS for iOS).

## Why RustChat?

### For Self-Hosters
- **Simple deployment** — One Docker Compose file, five minutes to running
- **Small resource footprint** — Runs comfortably on a 2GB VPS
- **Data ownership** — Your messages, your files, your database
- **No vendor lock-in** — Mattermost-compatible API means existing mobile apps work

### For Developers
- **Clean architecture** — Rust backend with explicit error handling, compile-time checked SQL
- **Real-time by design** — WebSocket-first with Redis pub/sub for clustering
- **Modern frontend** — Vue 3 Composition API, TypeScript, Pinia state management
- **Extensible** — Webhook and API key support for integrations

### For Security Teams
- **Memory-safe backend** — Rust eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities
- **Authenticated file access** — No presigned URL leaks, everything goes through auth
- **Audit trails** — Comprehensive logging of user and admin actions
- **Production hardening** — Environment-based security constraints

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- A server with 2GB RAM minimum

### 1. Get the Code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rustchatio/rustchat.git
cd rustchat
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set the required secrets:

```bash
# Required: Cryptographic secrets
RUSTCHAT_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
RUSTCHAT_ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Required: S3 credentials for file storage
RUSTCHAT_S3_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
RUSTCHAT_S3_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
RUSTFS_ACCESS_KEY=your-access-key
RUSTFS_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key

# Optional: SSO (GitHub, Google, OIDC)
# GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
# GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

### 3. Launch

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The services will be available at:
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:8080
- **API**: http://localhost:3000

### 4. Create First User

On first startup, set these environment variables to create an admin user:

```bash
RUSTCHAT_ADMIN_USER=admin
RUSTCHAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secure-password-here
```

Then restart: `docker compose restart backend`

## Project Status

**Current: Active Development (Pre-Release)**

RustChat is being actively developed with regular improvements. It is suitable for:
- ✅ Development and testing environments
- ✅ Small teams comfortable with occasional updates
- ✅ Organizations with ops capacity to manage self-hosted software

Use with appropriate caution for production workloads. Always test in a staging environment first.

### Recent Highlights

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 2026-03 | Entity Foundation Complete — API keys, rate limiting, mobile compatibility (95.1%) |
| 2026-02 | VoIP Push Notifications — Mobile call ringing for Android and iOS |
| 2026-01 | V4 API Coverage — Broad Mattermost compatibility for mobile clients |

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for detailed release history.

## <a name="limitations"></a>What rustchat Cannot (Yet) Do Completely

We believe in honest communication about capabilities:

### Partial Implementations
- **Plugins** — Plugin framework exists; most plugins are stubs returning `501`
- **Custom Profile Attributes** — UI exists but backend is limited
- **OAuth Apps** — Basic structure, not full marketplace
- **Bots** — Framework present, limited bot management

### Known Limits
- **Calls** — Control plane scales via Redis; media plane is instance-local (no distributed SFU mesh)
- **Search** — Full-text search exists but not as advanced as Elasticsearch-backed solutions

### Not Implemented
- **Federation** — No server-to-server messaging
- **Guest Accounts** — No temporary/external user access
- **Data Residency** — No geographic data partitioning
